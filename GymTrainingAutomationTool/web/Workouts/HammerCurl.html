    <h1>   Hammer Curl    </h1>
    <p> Grab a pair of dumbbells and let them hang at armâ€™s length next to your sides with your palms facing your thighs.
      Without moving your upper arms, bend your elbows and curl the dumbbells as close to your shoulders as you can. Pause,
      then slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. Each time you return to the starting position, completely straighten your arms
    </p>
