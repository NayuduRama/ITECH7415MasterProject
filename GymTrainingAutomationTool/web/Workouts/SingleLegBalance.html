        <h1>Single Leg Balance  </h1>
        <p> Keep shoes on and find a level area to do the test. Raise one leg at the hip so your thigh is parallel to the ground and your lower leg is hanging straight down.
          You can raise your arms for balance. Close your eyes for a couple of quick seconds to feel how it will be different once they are shut tight. Keeping good posture, so head up,
          close your eyes and balance. Your body must remain straight, so your hips and shoulders need to remain level. You can’t move your hips to one side and shoulders to the other for counterbalance.
          If you lose your balance it’s ok, start again, we want a good test.
          You will know when you have balanced as long as you can.
