        <h1>Cycling  </h1>
        <p> An upright bike more closely simulates riding a bicycle, while a recumbent bike lets you lean back and pedal with your legs in front of you.
          If you choose to do interval training, you will adjust the resistance so at times you have to work very hard.
          Follow these with rest periods by decreasing the resistance. Start slow and increase speed and resistance after a few minutes. At the end of the workout,
          slow down and decrease resistance to help bring your heart rate down. You can choose how long you want to exercise, monitor your heart rate, and set a specific resistance level.
          You can choose programs designed to burn fat, build certain muscles or increase endurance.
